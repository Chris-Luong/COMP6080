# Bonus features

## Miscellaneous

- Made the Slackr logo a link leading back to the channels screen
- Users can logout:
  - the logout button is in the top right corner like other websites and only appears once logged in
  - the login/registration form will be cleared
  - the page loads the login form
- Meaningful error messages were created in the frontend.

## Milestone 1

- Ensured that emails follow the format "user@email" using Regex in the registration form
- Ensured that no fields are empty

Both these assertions have their own error message.

- Added hints under the email field with an example format of valid input, and under the confirm password field in the registration form.
- Placed form in a container with box shadows to improve the user interface and make the form feel like an actual form instead of floating input fields.

## Milestone 2

- Channels list displays channels with a nice UI
  - Badge on the right displays public/private and with corresponding colours
  - Hovering on each channel shows a hover animation (colour and position change)
