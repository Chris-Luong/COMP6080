# UI Testing

Write a test for the "happy path" of a user that is described as:

- Registers successfully
- Creates a new listing successfully
- Updates the thumbnail and title of the listing successfully
- Publish a listing successfully
- Unpublish a listing successfully
- Make a booking successfully
- Logs out of the application successfully
- Logs back into the application successfully

(If working solo) include a short rationale of the testing you have undertaken within TESTING.md.
